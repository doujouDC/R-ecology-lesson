# An alternative version of the _Data Carpentry: R for data analysis and visualization of Ecological Data_ lesson

This is an introduction to R designed for participants with no programming
experience. It can be taught in 3/4 of a day (approximately 6 hours).

It is a redesigned version of [the original Data Carpentry lesson](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson), and is currently undergoing beta testing as part of a process to evaluate its suitability as a replacement in the curriculum. The initial effort towards this redesign was done by [Michael Culshaw-Maurer](https://github.com/MCMaurer) in another repository in The Carpentries Incubator: https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/R-ecology-lesson (now archived). See Michael's notes while preparing the redesign in [the update_plans.md file](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/R-ecology-lesson/blob/main/update_plan.md) of that repository.

The lesson starts with information about the R programming language and the RStudio interface. It then moves to loading in data and exploring how to visualise it with ggplot2. The next episode takes learners through an exploration of data frames and some common data cleaning operations, before discussing vectors and factors. The final episode introduces the flow of data in R, and how to combine operations to select, filter, and mutate a data frame.

## Providing feedback on this lesson

If you teach this redesigned lesson, please [open an issue](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/R-ecology-lesson-alternative/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3Adiscussion&projects=&template=pilot_workshop_feedback.yml&title=%5BPilot+workshop+feedback%5D%3A+) on this repository to share your experience. The Data Carpentry: Ecology Curriculum Advisory Committee is currently considering whether this version of the lesson should be adopted as part of the official curriculum. Any feedback you can provide about your experience teaching this lesson - especially if you can compare this to any previous experence you have had teaching the original version - will be very helpful in informing the CAC's decision-making.

## Prerequisites

The lesson assumes no prior knowledge of R or RStudio.
Learners should have R and RStudio installed on their computers. They will also
need to be able to install R packages from CRAN, create directories, and
download files.
See [the lesson website](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/index.html)
for instructions on installing R, RStudio, and the required R packages.
